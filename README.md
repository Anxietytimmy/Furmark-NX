# Furmark-NX

Heavily based off [Furmark by StanislavPetrovV](https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/FurMark/tree/main})

This project is heavily WIP at the moment. Textures are broken, but the shader is functional. 

Obviously, this does not replace any stability test, as no real error correction is in place yet. 
This application causes extreme power draw from the GPU, so use with caution.
