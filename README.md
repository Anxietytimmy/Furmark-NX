# Furmark-NX

Heavily based off [Furmark by StanislavPetrovV](https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/FurMark/tree/main})

A port of Furmark to the Nintendo Switch. 
This uses an OpenGL shader to draw as much power as possible.
As a result, running this for extended perioids will cause hardware damage, so use this at your own risk.
In its current state, textures and animations for the shader are fully functional. 
Many other features are planned, including a port to deko3D, UI, path tracing, error detection, benchmarks, multithreading, and shader customization.
